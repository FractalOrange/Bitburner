This is where we store information about what the ports are doing so I don't get confused. In this game ports can contain up to 50 elements.

Port 1 manages whether or not we're burning blades. If we are, it has a single 0 in it, when we finish a bladeburner loop, we write a 1. This triggers the 
ascension to stop timing the bladeburner loop and start working on factions.
It is referenced in factionwork.js and bladeburner.js.

Port 2 is reserverd for another bladeburner signal

Port 3 lists the factions we need to work for, from most to least important, and is produced by augmentbuyer. It lists all factions for the sleeves to work on
It is referenced in augmentbuyer.js, and sleeves.js.

Port 4 lists the factions we will buy augments from next ascension (because we will unlock donations, or it's just faster due to increased favour.)
It is referenced in augmentbuyer.js and sleeves.js (no need to mention it in factionwork.js since we don't work for these factions on our main body)

Port 5 lists the factions we need to work for, and is just for the main body. 
It is referenced in augmentbuyer.js and factionwork.js

Port 6 is reserved for more faction signals

Port 9 and 11 store the stocks that are increasing, and decreasing, respectively, in order from highest to lowest confidence. Ports 10 and 12 store the confidence levels.
We use them to communicate to our stockbuyer script which stocks to buy, our working script which companies to work for, and our hacking scripts whether to modify stocks with
growing and hacking.
